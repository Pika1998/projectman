## Settings.json

If you want to sort projects/change name of project/change path, You can type `pm edit` to open settings.json


#### Example settings:
```json
{
    "commandToOpen": "code",
    "projects": [
        {
            "name": "Project1",
            "path": "path/to/project1"
        },
        {
            "name": "Project2",
            "path": "path/to/project2",
            "editor": "atom"
        },
        {
            "name": "Project3",
            "path": "path/to/project3"
        }
    ]
}
```
This will show three projects in `pm open` and project2 will be opened in Atom and other projects will be opened in Visual Studio Code
